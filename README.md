# page-layout-css

Playground for page layouts with css

Based on the [Pluralsight course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/css-creating-page-layouts/) "Creating Page Layouts with CSS" by Paul Cheney.

*This course will teach you the basics of mobile-first, responsive web design to build a multiple page website and how to incorporate design principles for web development.*

- [layout-css](./src/layout-css/index.html): The shop responsive website using plain css (float, clearfix, 12-columns grid system)

- [layout-bootstrap](./src/layout-bootstrap/index.html): The shop responsive website using bootstrap (grid system, cards).

- [grid-with-flexbox](./src/grid-with-flexbox/index.html): An example of a responsive grid system implemented using flexbox instead of float.

- [grid-with-sass](./src/grid-with-sass/index.html): An example of a responsive grid system implemented via sass and flexbox.

*NB. The sass files are compiled with a standalone sass preprocessor. If you want to update them you need to do it separatly as no tools are ready to use in these examples.*
